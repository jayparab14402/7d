A)Performing Spatial Queries
Here we are working on 2 layers, line layer for river and point layer representing cities. The task is to
 execute spatial query to find all cities which are within 10 km s of river.
Required dataset:
ne_10m_rivers_lake_centerlines 10m_populated_places_simple
1.Add vector layer and open “ne_10m_rivers_lake_centerlines.shp” and “10m_populated_places_simple.shp” one by one.
2.Both the layers are loaded in QGIS.
3.We need to create buffers around point and line layers. But the layers which we have loaded are in Geographic
 CRS with the unit of degrees, this is not suitable here, because we want our analysis to use meters or kms.
 To do this, we need to re project our layers to the Projected CRS. For that right click on “10m_populated_places_simple”
 and select Save as…
4.On Save vector layer dialog box click on Browse button next to save as and select location for the new layer and give
 name as “populated_places_reprojected”, then click on Change button next to CRS, now we need to select proper CRS for 
generating buffers, Azimuthal Equidistance would be the best for this.
5.Back on Save vector layer dialog box, check the box next to Add saved file to map and click on Ok.
6.Repeat the same procedure for “ne_10m_rivers_lake_centerlines” layer and save new layer as “rivers_lake_reprojected”.
7.Just uncheck the boxes against original layers from layer pane. But still the CRS is not changed because of default setting,
 so click on Project  Project Properties…
8.On Project Properties window open CRS tab and uncheck “Enable on the fly CRS transformation” then click on Ok.
9.In QGIS main window right click on any reprojected layer in layer pane and select Zoom to Layer Extent.
10.Now we are ready to create buffers, click on Vector  Geoprocessing Tools Buffer.
11.In the buffer tool, select populated_places_reprojected layer as input. Enter buffer distance as 10000 (as we want a 
buffer of 10kms and since CRS units are in meters we need to enter 10000). Enter output file name as populated_places_buffer.
 Click on Ok.
12.When the processing is done, click on Yes to add newly created layer to TOC.
13.Repeat the same procedure for rivers_lake_reprojected layer and give name of output layer as rivers_lake_buffer.
14.Now, rivers_lake_buffer contains features that are rivers as well as lake, but we want only rivers for our analysis, 
so we will run query to select only river features. Right click on rivers_lake_buffer layer and select Open Attributes Table.
15.We can see the featurecla attribute which contains the information we can use to select the river feature, click on select 
features using an expression button.
16.Enter the expression “featurecla” = „River‟, click on Select button and then click on Close to return back to the main QGIS window.
17.We are ready to perform the spatial query. We need to enable the Spatial Query plugin to use this functionality. Once Spatial 
Query plugin is enabled, go to Vector  Spatial Query  Spatial Query.
18.For our query, we want to select features from the buffered places which intersect with the buffered river lines. Check the checkbox
 next to selected geometries. This is to make sure that the query uses only river features that we have selected previously. Click Apply.
19.Once the query is completed, we will see a new section named Selected features. Click on the Create layer with selected button.
 A new layer will be added to the Layers pane.
Click Close.
20.Zoom in to any area and compare the results. We will notice that the new layer contains only the features that intersect with 
river buffers. We can verify this just uncheck populated_places_buffer layer so that the canvas will display cities intersected with river.
Here, we are done with “Performing Spatial Queries”, next steps are for verification only.
21.We should always verify our results to ensure the analysis is accurate enough. One way to verify the results is to export this layer 
as a KML file and load it on Google Earth. We can check if the areas we found really are within 10kms of a river. Right-click the layer and Save As....
22.In the Save vector layer as window, select format as KML, choose WGS 84 as the CRS. This is because KML format needs the coordinates 
to be in Geometric CRS. Name KML layer as cities_near_river.kml.
23.Open Google Earth (https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/earth/) then click on “Launch Earth”. Click on Projects option and then click on Open.
 Select Import KML file from computer and open .kml file which we have created to verify that the cities represented by these buffers are actual close to rivers.
